One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""specimen unsatisfactory"".   

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.

If the observation result value is derived from the binary file (for example 'X' detected and here is the the proof in this image), the binary file may be directly represented using *DocumentReference* and referenced by `derivedFrom`.
- If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by the `code`.
-  *CodeableConcept* with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the `code` defines a coded value.
-  *Attachment* is used if the observation result value is a binary file such as an image.  If the observation result value is derived from the binary file (for example 'X' detected and here is the the proof in this image), the binary file may be directly represented using *DocumentReference* and referenced by `derivedFrom`.

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
